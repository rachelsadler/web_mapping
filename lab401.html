    <h1>My lab 4 web page!</h1>
    <p>This is the 4<sup>th</sup> lab for GIS 3410, web mapping, for MSU Denver. I already had a github account and home page so I created this new web_mapping respository specifically for this course.</p>
    <h3>One of my favorite recipes: Teriyaki Salmon</h3>
    <p>This is a recipe I have found and adapted from <a href="https://simplyhomecooked.com/grilled-teriyaki-salmon/">Simply Home Cooked</a>.</p>
