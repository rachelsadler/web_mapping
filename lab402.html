    <h1>My lab 4 web page!</h1>
    <p>This is the 4<sup>th</sup> lab for GIS 3410, web mapping, for MSU Denver. I already had a github account and home page so I created this new web_mapping respository specifically for this course.</p>
    <h3>One of my favorite recipes: Teriyaki Salmon</h3>
    <p>This is a recipe I have found and adapted from <a href="https://simplyhomecooked.com/grilled-teriyaki-salmon/">Simply Home Cooked</a>.</p>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>In a bowl, combine brown sugar, garlic, soy sauce, teriyaki sauce, and red pepper flakes. Set aside 1/2 cup in a small sauce pan.</li>
      <li>In the bowl add the olive oil and chopped green onion.</li>
      <li>Place the salmon fillets in a container with a lid and pour the bowl with the marinade into the container. Put the lid on and store in the fridge for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Mix the 1 Tbsp of corn starch with 1 Tbsp of water in a small bowl. Once this has combined, add it to the 1/2 cup of marinade in the small sauce pan. Cook on medium-low heat, stirring contantly, until it begins to thicken into a glaze.</li>
      <li>After the salmon has been marinating for 30 minutes, cook the salmon in an air fryer at 400 degree fahrenheit for 8 minutes.</li>
      <li>When the salmon is done, serve with glaze and enjoy!</li>
